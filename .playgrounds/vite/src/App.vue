      On the photo, it's me speaking at BDX I/O 2025 in Bordeaux, France. I wrote an article if you want to <a href="https://soubiran.dev/posts/twice-in-one-day-speaking-at-bdx-io-2025-at-bordeaux">learn more about my talk at BDX I/O</a>. Otherwise, you can also <a href="https://soubiran.dev/posts/erase-cls-by-automatically-optimizing-images-with-vite">read my article to dive into this plugin</a> that optimizes images to erase CLS.
